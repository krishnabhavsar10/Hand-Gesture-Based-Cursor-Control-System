# Hand Gesture Based Cursor Control System
 This project is a hand gesture-based cursor control system using computer vision. It allows the user to control the cursor on the screen using their hand movements captured by the webcam. The system is implemented in Python and uses the OpenCV library for image processing and the Mediapipe library for hand tracking.
